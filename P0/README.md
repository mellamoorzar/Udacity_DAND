# Project 0: Analyze Bay Area Bike Share Data

This is Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree project work which to help us identify the key steps of the data analysis process.

Use real-life data provided by Bay Area Bike Share to determine differences in usage between commuters and tourists' ridership patterns, average duration of trips, and more.

## Environments

Anaconda with Python 2.7.12
* [Evironment for Mac](https://github.com/mellamoorzar/Udacity_DAND/blob/master/Evironments/dand-env-mac.yaml)

## File List

**Main Report:**

[Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Data_Analysis.ipynb](Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Data_Analysis.ipynb)

**Python Scripts:**

babs_datacheck.py; babs_visualizations.py - Supplemental scripts for checking data wrangling, reporting of basic statistics, and creation of exploratory bar charts and histograms.

**Data:**

Data is split among twelve other files, organized into three sets of four files each. Prefixing each set is one of three datestamps, showing the end month for each data collection period (201402, 201408, 201508). Suffixes for each file indicate contents:

* \*\_README.txt - Information about contents of data files.
* \*\_station\_data.csv - Basic information about station locations and capacities.
* \*\_trip\_data.csv - Information about each trip taken using the bike share system.
* \*\_weather\_data.csv - Weather information by day for one station in each city in the bike share program.
