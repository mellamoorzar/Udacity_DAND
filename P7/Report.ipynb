    "The data set of Titanic is a simple one, but the whole story behind it is not that simple. With different point of views there are always something we could find out. My story is that Titanic didn't sink equally for everyone. Regardless of the truth behind \"women and children first\", wealth and social status played an important role on surviving the disaster."

    "1. Distribution of passengers: I used a bar chart to visualize the passenger distribution on `Pclass` and `Age-Gender` category. I think this is the most intuitive way, and is most familiar to the reader. With 3 pie charts, I wanted to emphasize the proportion of these passenger groups.\n",
    "2. Survival facts of passengers: Again I used a bar chart to visualize the overall status of survived and non-survived passengers. And I put 2 groups of donut charts together to compare the survival rate of women, children and men, and the survival rate of 1st class, 2nd class and 3rd class passenger.\n",
    "3. Families on board: I filtered out the families with more than 5 members on board and plotted the family survival rate with bar charts. Yes I think bar chart is easy to understand in this situation. I also used table to list all family members with more details like `Gender`, `Age`, `Fare` and `Survived?`. Tables are suitable for details.\n",
