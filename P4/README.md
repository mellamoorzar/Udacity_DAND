# Project 4: Exploratory Data Analysis on Red Wine Quality with R

This is Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree project work for Exploratory Data Analysis part.

It was to explore relationships in red wine quality to multiple chemical properties and explore the data set for distributions, outliers and anomalies, with R and EDA techniques.

## Environments

R (the software environment for statistical computing and graphics)

## File List

**Main Report:**

[Red_Wine_Quality_EDA.rmd](Red_Wine_Quality_EDA.rmd)

**Data:**

wineQualityReds.csv - A tidy data set contains 1,599 red wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).
